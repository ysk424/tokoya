"""Hair Simulation — VBD-direction Phase 2: head-tracked VBD (α strategy).

**What this module owns**

  * The per-frame state (positions + velocities in world coords) held
    in `_prev_state`. Updated by exactly two authors, each of which
    commits both fields atomically at the end of the function:
      - `_capture_current_state` (reads EVALUATED from Blender; used
        on Start, Reset, frame-jump)
      - `_run_one_simulation_step` (uses VBD output; used on +1 step)
  * The full-animation RAM bake: parallel arrays
    `_bake_positions[n_frames, n_total, 3]` and
    `_bake_velocities[n_frames, n_total, 3]` plus a per-frame
    `_bake_mask` boolean. Allocated once at Start (or reused if size
    matches), sized by the scene's animation length.
  * The simulation step: NVIDIA Newton's `SolverVBD`. Hair roots are
    kinematic (mass=0 → driven by us each step from the evaluated
    Surface Deform output); other points are integrated under
    gravity + per-strand spring forces. Sloppy physics constants for
    the explosion test: any non-zero stiffness/damping; user-approved
    that hair may visibly explode as long as Python does not crash.
  * The scrub-restore behaviour: if the user enters a frame that has
    been baked, the baked state is pushed back to Blender — the
    simulator never re-derives it.

**α strategy: head-tracked roots + modifier offset compensation**

User-chosen pragmatic approach (acknowledged as not the architecturally
"pure" way; see CLAUDE.md / commit history for the discussion):

  * Surface Deform GN modifier ("サーフェス変形") stays active and is
    NOT muted. It provides per-frame head-tracked anchor positions
    via the EVALUATED Curves.
  * Every sim step:
      1. Read evaluated world positions (head-tracked) for all points.
      2. Read original world positions (what we wrote last frame).
      3. offset = evaluated - original  (per-particle additive modifier
         contribution; v0.0.27 verified the modifier composes ~additively).
      4. Build VBD input: prev non-root positions + new evaluated roots;
         derived root velocity = (new_eval - prev) / dt.
      5. VBD step → vbd_out in world coords, head-tracked.
      6. Write to ORIGINAL: vbd_out - offset. Modifier then produces
         evaluated = (vbd_out - offset) + offset = vbd_out → matches
         what VBD intended. No double-tracking.
  * `_prev_state` after each sim = VBD output (vbd_out), so the next
    step's "previous frame" is the head-tracked world view.

**What this module does NOT own**

  * Mode (Bypass / Simulating / Playback) — lives in
    `WindowManager.hair_sim_mode`, set by operators.
  * Which entry point to call per frame — that decision is in the
    `frame_change_post` handler in `__init__.py`.

**Three modes (decided by handler)**

  * SIMULATING → calls `step(scene)`:
      - If current frame is baked → restore from bake (scrub-back).
      - Else if current == _last_frame + 1 → run sim, capture, bake.
      - Else (jump into unbaked area) → re-baseline (capture with
        zero velocity), do NOT bake.

  * PLAYBACK → calls `playback(scene)`:
      - If current frame is baked → restore from bake.
      - Else → do nothing (Blender shows whatever obj.data currently
        contains; no implicit re-baseline).

  * BYPASS → handler returns early; this module is not called at all.

**Why `_last_frame` and `_prev_state` are always updated together**

Simulation = state evolution. To compute the next state we need the
previous state. If the two ever drifted apart, the next +1-frame step
would solve from stale data. They are updated atomically inside
`_capture_current_state` (and inside `_restore_from_bake`, which is
also a single-point write).

**HairFrameState contents**

  points_world      — (n_total, 3) float32, world coords. ALL points
                       (roots + every joint).
  velocities_world  — (n_total, 3) float32, world m/sec. Derived only
                       after a successful +1 simulation step. Zero on
                       Start / scrub-back / frame-jump.
  frame             — int, the frame this snapshot corresponds to.

**Modifier policy**

The target Curves object carries a Geometry Nodes modifier
"サーフェス変形". This module does NOT touch it. Verified
2026-05-26 (v0.0.27): writes to original `position` persist and
the Modifier composes its head-tracking offset additively on top.

**Phase 1 invariants preserved**

Exactly one persistent `frame_change_post` handler, gated by
`WindowManager.hair_sim_mode != "BYPASS"`. step() / playback() are
invoked at most once per frame change.

        **Strategy α — head-tracked roots + modifier-offset compensation**

        The hair roots' world positions for the new frame are taken from
        the EVALUATED Curves (Surface Deform output), so VBD sees the
        head motion as a moving boundary condition. The non-root
        particles' world positions are carried over from the previous
        sim's output (held in `_prev_state`).

          Input to VBD:
            q [non_root]  = _prev_state.points_world[non_root]
            q [root]      = evaluated_world[root]                      ← head boundary
            qd[non_root]  = _prev_state.velocities_world[non_root]    ← inertia
            qd[root]      = 0                                          ← see warning below

        ⚠ Kinematic-root velocity is intentionally zero. XPBD's predict
        step (verified on a 2-particle probe at the XPBD line, v0.0.38)
        integrates ALL particles by `x_new = x_old + v*dt`, including
        mass=0 — it only skips constraint corrections. Passing the
        derived head velocity there causes `solver_out[root] =
        2*eval_now - eval_prev` (the "hair drifts 2× the head" bug).
        VBD's internal integration is different (energy-based,
        coordinate descent) and may not have the same bug, but the
        fix is harmless: in_q[root] = eval_now is authoritative,
        spring forces feel root motion through frame-to-frame position
        change, no velocity needs to be communicated for kinematic
        particles. Keeping it zero on VBD too as a defensive carryover.

        Spring forces (rest length fixed at the initial geometry) pull
        the non-root particles toward the moved roots over subsequent
        iterations, producing inertial trailing of the hair tips.

        VBD output is in world coords and is "head-tracked" (because
        the input was). To display correctly, we must NOT let the
        Surface Deform modifier add its head-tracking offset on top
        again. We measure the modifier's per-particle additive offset
        (`offset = evaluated - original`) and subtract it from the VBD
        output before writing to ORIGINAL. Modifier then computes
        `evaluated = written + offset = vbd_out`, matching VBD's view.
