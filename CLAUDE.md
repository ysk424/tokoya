# Project Working Notes (for future Claude Code sessions)

This file is a handoff log. Read it before doing anything in this repository.
Treat it as a living context document, updated when phases close.

## What this project is

A Blender 5.1 extension that will eventually host a **NVIDIA PhysX**-backed
hair simulation. Today the extension is a minimal skeleton; PhysX, GPU,
and C++ solver code are all deliberately deferred to later phases.

Target platform initially: **Windows x64 only**. Avoid choices that
permanently lock out Linux/macOS, but do not test or implement them.

Owner / single developer: `azoo` (GitHub `ysk424`). Communication is
mostly in Japanese — when in doubt, mirror the user's language.

`_native_loader.py` + `native/phase2b_probe.cp313-win_amd64.pyd`. The
.pyd must be present at build time or the extension build fails.

## Phase history (load-bearing)

The user enforces strict phase discipline: each phase has a written
design, an explicit GO from the user, and a minimal scope. **Do not
expand scope or merge phases without explicit approval.**

| Phase | Outcome | Commit |
|---|---|---|
| **1** | Minimal extension: Start/Stop/Reset operators, `SolverInterface` stub, `frame_change_post @persistent` handler, WindowManager `hair_sim_running` (SKIP_SAVE), N-panel "HairSim" | `ec6e468` (then layout flatten `5772e97`, manifest paths `2343791`) |
| **2A** | One-shot pybind11 .pyd built with system Python 3.13 imports successfully into Blender 5.1's bundled Python 3.13.9 via sys.path injection. Confirmed ABI compatibility despite patch-level mismatch | (no commit — temp dir experiment) |
| **2B** | Repo-tracked build: `native/probe.cpp`, `native/setup.py`, `native/build.cmd`. Built .pyd is gitignored; built artifact loads from repo via MCP sys.path test | `98a12d6` |
| **2C** | Extension reaches native via `_native_loader.py`. `HAIR_SIM_NATIVE_DIR` env var only. `hair_sim.probe_native` operator (INTERNAL, no UI). Phase 1 invariants preserved | `3dfb125` |
| **2D** | Native .pyd bundled inside extension zip at `<pkg>/native/`. Loader priority γ: **env var first, bundled fallback, None**. Loader uses `importlib.util.spec_from_file_location` and overrides `__file__` to defeat CPython's single-phase extension cache (so the chosen path is visible to callers). `platforms = ["windows-x64"]` added | `4c7e0ec` |
| **3A** | Read-only investigation of `YOKO__EXT_TEST.blend` (`C:\Users\azoo\Documents\Blender\QueSera2\YOKO__EXT_TEST.blend`). Hair = single Curves object `カーブ.001`, 4474 strands × 8 points = 35,792 points, uniform 8 points/curve. Modifier stack: Geometry Nodes "サーフェス変形" (Surface Deform). Evaluated data differs from original (Surface Deform applied). Memory budget table for 1411 frames | (MCP only) |
| **3B** | Read evaluated `position` via `foreach_get` into `array.array('f')` (107,376 floats / 419 KiB per frame) and into `bytearray + memoryview.cast('f')`. Per-frame and 32-frame multi-frame chunks behave identically. Dominant cost = `frame_set` + depsgraph eval ≈ 60 ms/frame; foreach itself is sub-ms | (MCP only) |
| **3C** | Writeback to **original** Curves data works. Direct assignment and `foreach_set` both succeed. `obj.data.update_tag()` + re-`evaluated_depsgraph_get()` propagates to evaluated data. Surface Deform consumes original positions (applies a roughly linear ~0.91× transform on the offset before reaching evaluated coords). Viewport visibly changes once enough strands are moved (~1000+) | (MCP only) |
| **3D** | Full-frame writeback (all 35,792 points). Per-frame deformation total ≈ **46 ms**: depsgraph re-eval **37 ms (~81%)**, Python loop 6.4 ms, foreach_get+set 0.14 ms combined | (MCP only) |
| **3E** | Temporary `frame_change_post` handler drives non-cumulative deformation across frames 800–840. Deterministic (revisit same frame → same shape), Phase 1 handler count unaffected, handler removed cleanly after test. ~110 ms/frame end-to-end via `frame_set` | (MCP only) |
| **4A** | `describe_curves(name, counts, attribute fingerprint, ...)` in `native/probe.cpp`. Metadata-only round-trip Python → C++ → Python via `py::dict`. UTF-8 string round-trip OK | `fabf63c` |
| **4B** | `probe_position_buffer(metadata, py::buffer)`. Read-only ingest of one frame's float32 buffer (107,376 floats) via the Python buffer protocol. Both `array.array('f')` and `bytearray+memoryview.cast('f')` accepted identically. Computes min/max/sum/avg/checksum; returns dict. Pointer not retained; input not mutated. `first_vec3` matches Phase 3B baseline bit-for-bit | `5698baa` |
| **4C** | `deform_position_buffer(metadata, amplitude, py::buffer)` returns a **new** `py::bytes` result buffer alongside summary. Deterministic per-strand z-offset: root 0, tip +amplitude, linear interpolation. Input not mutated; result memory is Python-owned. `checksum_delta` matches closed-form theory (`amplitude × 4 × n_strands`) | `c96d147` |
| **4D** | First end-to-end round-trip Blender↔C++↔Blender attempted with **evaluated→original** writeback. **Mechanically passed all API checks** but caused a double Surface Deform application — hair detached from head (`eval_first` shifted from -0.319 to -0.620). Documented as the textbook landmine #2 outcome; path **rejected as the canonical route** | (MCP only) |
| **4D2** | Canonical round-trip: **original→C++→original**. Hair deforms naturally and stays attached to the head. Root completely fixed (eval delta = (0,0,0)), tip lifts (eval z delta +0.236 from input +0.25). Surface Deform applies its transform once on the modified rest pose | (MCP only) |
| **4E** | Time-driven non-cumulative C++ deformation across frames 800–840 via temporary `frame_change_post` handler. C++ replaces Phase 3E's pure Python loop: handler-internal cost **0.24 ms** (vs 12 ms in 3E, ~50× faster). 1-frame end-to-end stays at ~100 ms because Blender-side depsgraph/Surface Deform/rig dominates. Determinism, baseline restore, handler cleanup, Phase 1 invariants all verified | (MCP only) |
| **5A** | PhysX 5.6.1 lifecycle probe: `physx_probe_open / status / close` in `native/probe.cpp`. CPU only (no GPU, no CUDA, no simulation, no rigid bodies). PhysX SDK cloned to **`C:\Users\azoo\git\PhysX`** (sibling dir, not in this repo), built with custom preset `vc17win64-cpu-md` (CPU only + dynamic CRT `/MD` to match pybind11). Open → status → close round-trips, idempotent re-open/re-close, Blender never crashes. First crash on 0.0.8 (`PhysX_64.dll` delay-loads `PhysXCommon_64.dll`, which `os.add_dll_directory` does NOT cover) → fixed in 0.0.9 by preloading the 3 PhysX DLLs in dependency order via `ctypes.WinDLL` inside `_native_loader.py` | this commit |

**Phase 3 left no repo changes by design.** Phases 4D, 4D2, 4E left no
repo changes either (MCP-only). The committed Phase 4 surface is
`4A` + `4B` + `4C` in `native/probe.cpp`. Phase 5A adds open/status/close
to the same file plus PhysX runtime DLL preloading in
`_native_loader.py` and PhysX link settings in `native/setup.py`.

---

## External PhysX SDK location (Phase 5A onward)

PhysX 5 is **not** vendored in this repo. It lives outside:

```
C:\Users\azoo\git\PhysX                  ← shallow clone of NVIDIA-Omniverse/PhysX (5.6.1)
└── physx\
    ├── include\                          # source headers (unused; we use install/)
    ├── source\, compiler\, ...           # SDK sources + generated VS projects
    ├── buildtools\presets\public\
    │   └── vc17win64-cpu-md.xml         # custom preset (CPU only + /MD CRT)
    └── install\vc17win64-cpu-md\PhysX\   # build output, consumed by setup.py
        ├── include\                      # public headers
        └── bin\win.x86_64.vc143.md\release\
            ├── PhysXFoundation_64.{lib,dll}
            ├── PhysXCommon_64.{lib,dll}
            ├── PhysX_64.{lib,dll}
            └── PhysXExtensions_static_64.lib, PhysXPvdSDK_static_64.lib (link only)
```

**Why a custom preset:** the stock `vc17win64-cpu-only.xml` preset
builds with `/MT` (static CRT) which is ABI-incompatible with the
pybind11 module (built `/MD`). The custom `vc17win64-cpu-md.xml`
preset flips `NV_USE_STATIC_WINCRT=False` and also disables snippets
and OmniPVD to keep the build minimum.

**To rebuild PhysX from scratch:**
1. `cd C:\Users\azoo\git\PhysX\physx`
2. `generate_projects.bat vc17win64-cpu-md` (needs VS cmake on PATH)
3. Open `compiler\vc17win64-cpu-md\PhysXSDK.sln` in MSBuild (or VS),
   build the `INSTALL` project, configuration `release`, platform `x64`.
4. Re-run `native/build.cmd` to re-link `phase2b_probe.pyd` against the
   updated PhysX libs.
5. Re-copy `PhysX_64.dll`, `PhysXCommon_64.dll`, `PhysXFoundation_64.dll`
   into `native/` (they are `.gitignore`d).

**Override the PhysX install path** by setting `PHYSX_INSTALL_DIR`
before running `native/build.cmd`. Default is the sibling path above.

**Delay-load caveat:** `PhysX_64.dll` declares `PhysXCommon_64.dll` as
a *delay-loaded* dependency. The Microsoft delay-load helper uses raw
`LoadLibrary` calls that do NOT respect `os.add_dll_directory`. The
loader (`_native_loader.py`) therefore explicitly preloads PhysX DLLs
in dependency order (Foundation → Common → PhysX) via `ctypes.WinDLL`
with absolute paths before importing the extension module. Without
that preload, `PxCreatePhysics` crashes with VC EH delay-load failure
`0xc06d007e`.

---

## Performance stance (Phase 4 conclusion — load-bearing)

After Phase 4E, per-call cost is dissected as follows for the
YOKO__EXT_TEST.blend / カーブ.001 scene (35,792 points, single Curves
object, Surface Deform Geometry Nodes + Armature rig):

| Layer | Per-frame cost | Status |
|---|---|---|
| C++ deformation (`deform_position_buffer`) | ~0.14 ms | negligible |
| Python ↔ C++ buffer transfer (in/out, copy via `py::bytes`) | ~0.10 ms total | negligible |
| `foreach_get` / `foreach_set` on 107,376 floats | ~0.10 ms total | negligible |
| **Blender depsgraph + Surface Deform + rig evaluation** | **~95–100 ms** | **dominant, accepted** |

**Stance:**

1. The hair-extension code path (C++ deform + buffer transfer +
   foreach_get/set) is **already fast enough** for the foreseeable
   roadmap. Further micro-optimization there is wasted effort.
2. The dominant cost is **the existing rig** (Surface Deform on
   `カーブ.001`, Armature on the body meshes, etc.). This is **not**
   the extension's cost; it is the scene's cost.
3. Surface Deform **cannot be removed** in this scene. It is the
   mechanism that attaches hair curves to the body. Any path that
   bypasses it implies consuming a *baked* dataset instead of the live
   rig output.
4. Surface Deform / Geometry Nodes integration, modifier reordering,
   custom evaluators, and rig replacement are **explicitly out of
   scope** for the current line of work. Do not propose or implement
   them without an explicit go-ahead.
5. When benchmarking future phases, attribute costs to either
   "extension code" or "scene rig" and do not optimize the latter.

## Canonical data round-trip (after Phase 4D2)

The official boundary path for all subsequent work is:

```
obj.data.attributes["position"]              ← ORIGINAL space
        │                          (foreach_get into array.array('f'))
        ▼
   Python buffer (input)
        │
        ▼
native.deform_position_buffer(...)            ← C++ reads buffer,
        │                                       writes new result
        ▼
   Python buffer (result via py::bytes)
        │              (array.array('f').frombytes)
        ▼
obj.data.attributes["position"]              ← ORIGINAL space
        │                          (foreach_set)
        ▼
obj.data.update_tag()
        │
        ▼
evaluated_depsgraph_get() / viewport         ← Surface Deform applies
                                                exactly once here
```

**Forbidden anti-pattern (Phase 4D):**
- Read **evaluated** + write **original** → double Surface Deform →
  hair flies off head.

Whenever the round-trip is touched in a future phase, this diagram
applies. If a phase needs to deviate (e.g., the future "consume baked
data" path), it must be designed and acknowledged explicitly.

---

## Critical landmines (Curves / depsgraph work)

These are non-negotiable. They are also saved as a separate memory
entry (`feedback_curves_landmines.md`); read both.

1. **Write to original, observe via evaluated.** Never write to
   evaluated data; treat evaluated objects as read-only snapshots.
2. **Original-space offset ≠ evaluated-space offset.** Surface Deform /
   Geometry Nodes transform the result. Only require "some evaluated
   change occurs," not a specific value.
3. **Don't persist evaluated / depsgraph references.** Acquire, read,
   discard. They are session-temporary.
4. **Attribute domains have different lengths.** POINT-domain `position`
   has 35,792 entries on `カーブ.001`; CURVE-domain
   `surface_uv_coordinate` has 4474. Never flatten under one length.
5. **`bpy.data.is_dirty` is unreliable for Curves writes.** Phases 3C/3D/3E
   all modified Curves memory while `is_dirty` stayed `False`. Falsy
   `is_dirty` is not evidence the scene is unchanged. **Never use it
   to gate save decisions.**
6. **After any destructive Curves test, never `Ctrl+S`.** Recover via
   `File > Revert`, reload, or close without saving.
7. **Don't wire writeback into `frame_change_post` permanently yet.**
   Phase 3E proved the path works as a one-off; production wiring is a
   separate risk class (timing, viewport, threading) and needs its own
   phase.
8. **PhysX / CUDA / GPU / numpy / SolverInterface wiring stay
   deferred.** C++ transfer was promoted in Phase 4 (it is now the
   canonical round-trip), but the rest of this list must remain
   deferred until explicitly unblocked.
9. **Don't over-optimize foreach_get/set or the C++ deformation
   itself.** They are sub-ms. Dominant cost is `frame_set` +
   depsgraph + Surface Deform + rig (~95–110 ms/frame). This cost
   belongs to the existing scene rig, not to the extension, and is
   explicitly out of scope (see "Performance stance" above).
10. **No single giant contiguous allocation.** Work in chunked
    contiguous buffers (per-frame / N-frame chunk / strand-group).
    Working tentative direction: "chunked contiguous + float32."

---

## Placeholders not yet finalized

These names are intentional placeholders. Each is confined to **one
location** so a future phase can rename in a single edit. Do not spread
them.

| Placeholder | Location | Finalize in |
|---|---|---|
| Native module name `phase2b_probe` | `native/probe.cpp` (PYBIND11_MODULE), `_native_loader.py` (`_MODULE_NAME`), `blender_manifest.toml` (`[build].paths`) | When solver shape is known |
| `_native_loader.py` / `get_native()` | `_native_loader.py`, `__init__.py` operator import | When the boundary API stabilizes |
| `HAIR_SIM_NATIVE_DIR` env var | `_native_loader.py` (`_ENV_VAR`) | When dev/prod split is real |
| Bundled subdir `native` | `_native_loader.py` (`_BUNDLED_SUBDIR`) | Same |

---

## Current operational state

* Latest user-installed extension version is whatever was last built into
  `dist/`. Manifest in repo is `0.0.4`. **Always bump `version` in
  `blender_manifest.toml` before producing a new zip the user will
  install** (`feedback_version_bump.md`); otherwise Blender's
  install-from-disk refuses without manual uninstall.
* Uninstall via CLI when needed (full path required):
  `"C:/Program Files/Blender Foundation/Blender 5.1/blender.exe" --command extension remove hair_sim_physx`
  Blender must be **fully closed** first (DLL is locked while loaded).
* Manual UI install: `Edit > Preferences > Get Extensions > Install from Disk`
  with the zip in `dist/`. Then **restart Blender** for native module
  isolation.
* Verification pattern: MCP-driven in a freshly restarted Blender.
  Always check Phase 1 invariants at the end (handler count = 1,
  `hair_sim_running == False`, object count unchanged, `git status`
  clean).

### Phase 1 invariants (must remain true)

* `bpy.app.handlers.frame_change_post` contains exactly **one** handler
  with `__module__` starting with `bl_ext.user_default.hair_sim_physx`.
* `bpy.context.window_manager.hair_sim_running` exists, defaults
  `False`, is `SKIP_SAVE`.
* Operators `hair_sim.start`, `hair_sim.stop`, `hair_sim.reset` are
  idempotent no-ops on re-entry, do not depend on native availability,
  and never appear in the operator search (`HAIR_SIM_OT_probe_native`
  is `INTERNAL`).
* `ui.py` and `blender_manifest.toml` semantics unchanged across
  Phase 2 sub-phases; only Phase 2D added `version`, `platforms`, and
  one `[build].paths` entry.

---

## Development workflow

* Python: system Python 3.13.13 (`py -3.13`) → `.venv/` (already
  created). pybind11 3.0.4, setuptools, ninja, scikit-build-core are
  installed (the latter two are unused in the current setup but
  available).
* MSVC: Visual Studio 2022 BuildTools, MSVC 14.44.35207 at
  `C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\BuildTools\`.
* Build native .pyd: `native/build.cmd` (initializes vcvars64, calls
  setup.py via `.venv` python).
* Build extension zip:
  `"C:/Program Files/Blender Foundation/Blender 5.1/blender.exe" --command extension build --source-dir . --output-dir dist`
* The user runs Blender. Many tests need the user to manually restart
  Blender between iterations because Windows holds .pyd DLL handles
  for the lifetime of the process. Plan tests around restart points.
* MCP is the primary test harness. Prefer one-shot MCP scripts over
  adding throwaway operators to the extension.

---

## Branches

* `main` — current line of work, HEAD `9f0b8e5` (Phase 5A: PhysX
  5.6.1 open/close probe). Run `git log --oneline -10` for the real
  current state — this comment can lag.
* `phase2-cpp` — quarantined early scaffolding (full C++/PhysX/CMake/
  scikit-build-core/scripts/extern submodule) that was stripped from
  main when Phase 1 was reset. Reference only — do not cherry-pick
  blindly. Re-derive cleanly per phase instead.

---

## Memory (`.claude/projects/.../memory/`)

The harness loads these on startup. Cross-reference them, don't
duplicate. Update them rather than the inline list when feedback
arrives.

* `feedback_version_bump.md` — bump manifest version every install
  iteration.
* `feedback_curves_landmines.md` — the 10 Curves rules above (longer
  version with reasons).
* `feedback_performance_stance.md` — Phase 4E conclusion: extension
  code path is sub-ms; Surface Deform / rig cost (~100 ms/frame) is
  the scene's, not the extension's, and is out of scope.

---

## Pending / next phase candidates (not yet designed)

These are *candidates*. None are committed to. Each needs its own
design pass + user GO before implementation:

* **Phase 5B (?)** — first PhysX simulation step. Inside the C++
  side already opened in 5A: add a placeholder rigid body or two,
  call `PxScene::simulate(dt)` + `fetchResults()`, read back a
  position, release. Still no Curves, still CPU only, still no GPU,
  no Blender-side wiring. Confirms the simulator runs without
  destabilizing the lifecycle established in 5A.
* **Phase 5C (?)** — SolverInterface wiring: replace the Python
  stub body of `start / stop / reset / step` so that pressing
  Start/Stop drives the PhysX context open/close, and `step` runs
  a single PhysX `simulate(dt)`. Still no Curves data exchange.
  Mind landmine #7 (permanent `frame_change_post` wiring is a
  separate risk class — gate behind `hair_sim_running` exactly like
  Phase 1's stub already does).
* **Phase 6 (?)** — first contact between Phase 4D2's Curves
  round-trip and Phase 5C's PhysX scene: spawn one rigid body per
  strand point (or one per strand), simulate, write transformed
  positions back through the canonical original→C++→original path.
  Mind landmine #2 (original-space != evaluated-space).
* **Phase 7 (?)** — Curves bake path: investigate consuming a baked
  dataset so Surface Deform can be bypassed when desired. Out of
  scope for normal operation.
* **Phase 8+ (?)** — PhysX GPU / CUDA. Far away. Requires re-enabling
  the GPU build options in the PhysX preset, redistributing CUDA
  runtime DLLs, and accepting all the risks the current sibling-dir
  CPU-only build deliberately avoided.

When a new phase begins, do not skip steps:
1. Wait for a design request from the user.
2. Produce a design doc (options / risks / minimum completion
   criteria / Desktop alignment points) in the chat — no
   implementation.
3. Iterate on the design until the user issues an explicit GO with
   modifications.
4. Implement minimally; verify via MCP; report results.
5. Commit only what was approved; never add docs / operators / files
   the user did not ask for.

---

## Things the user has been explicit about

* Tests pass/fail criteria belong to the user, not the implementer.
* "**実装は禁止です**" / "実施禁止です" means hard stop — produce a
  design only.
* When asked to push or commit, check `git status` first. If nothing
  is staged or modified, say so rather than synthesizing artifacts.
* Do not create README/docs files unless asked.
* Do not run UI/visual checks by yourself — the user is at the
  keyboard and prefers verifying visually after explicit work.
* When Blender state matters, the user prefers to restart Blender
  themselves; coordinate by asking "終了完了 / 起動完了" markers.
* Default to Japanese in chat unless the user switches.
